"""The source-delivery contract is ONE contract, asserted mechanically.

Every ported distillation step delivers ``gb_steps_post_training.distillation`` the same
way: the same ``code_config`` block, and the same region at the top of its ``run:``. That
sameness is the whole point — six subtly different copies of credential handling and
PYTHONPATH resolution is exactly the failure this avoids — so it is asserted rather than
described.

THIS step is the reference. Its own test_step_template.py asserts the region is
*correct*; this file asserts every other ported step's copy is byte-identical to it. The
two together are what let each other step's suite skip re-asserting the twelve
properties: identical to a correct reference is correct.

Living here rather than in a shared conftest is deliberate — it is the reference step's
job to notice when a copy has drifted, and a test that scans its siblings finds a NEW
ported step automatically rather than waiting for someone to add it to a list.
